# Course Project | Game Engine Design and Implementation
Jaden Chen 100912701

#### Group formation
I decided to work alone on this project for two reasons: to get a more in-depth understanding of the course material, and to create systems that will most likely be implemented in my GDW game. I figured that for this project, it would be a good idea to create systems that could be used in my GDW game, so 
I could save time by creating 5 systems applicable to both my GDW game and this project, instead of creating 5 systems specifically for this project, then having to create an additional 1-5 for my game.

- I will be contributing 100% of the work and will be responsible for the Singleton, Factory, Command, Plugin/DLL, and Observation design pattern ideation and implementation.

#### Interactive media scenario information
The scenario I will be using to develop the assignment's deliverables will be a boss fight scene inspired by my GDW game. The purpose of this scenario is to provide a small scope game that presents all implementations of the assignment deliverables and to create systems eligible to be implemented in my GDW game. 
The player is expected to use various weapons, such as a fire or water sword, to defeat the boss. The game will include audio functionality, a combat system, a boss enemy, and various systems to handle health, damage, visual effects, etc.
